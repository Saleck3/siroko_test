# Siroko interview technical test

This repo contains a coding exercise from the Siroko interview process

## Resume

This software should simulate an cart API and checkout system for an e-commerce

## Installation

After cloning the repo, copy and rename “example.env” to “.env” and set the variables values to the one that you prefer
Then run:
```
docker compose up -d
```

And navigate to [localhost](https://localhost/) (You should get a certificates warning, thats expected, just [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334))

On the browser you only gonna get the "Welcome to Symfony 7" placeholder but the app should be up and running at this point
